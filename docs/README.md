# 🛠️ Terraforming My Career

This repository documents my journey as I transition from a Senior Systems Engineer into a modern Cloud & Platform Engineering role.

Here you'll find:
- Hands-on labs built using Terraform, AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes
- Personal notes, cheat sheets, and CLI references
- A week-by-week learning plan and curated reading list
- My reflections and progress as I move from traditional ops to DevOps, IaC, and platform automation

---

## 🧭 What's Inside

- `terraform/` – Labs, notes, and demos using Terraform with AWS
- `aws/` – Notes on core AWS services as I refresh and expand my cloud knowledge
- `docker/` – Container fundamentals, Dockerfiles, CI/CD automation
- `kubernetes/` – Local cluster setup, manifests, Helm, and observability
- `meta/` – Learning plan, reading schedule, and project structure
- `cheatsheets/` – Quick reference guides for tools and commands

## 🎯 My Goal

To build the skills, confidence, and portfolio needed to grow into a role as a **Cloud Engineer**, **DevOps Engineer**, or **Platform/Site Reliability Engineer** — through self-directed learning, hands-on experimentation, and real-world documentation.

## 👋 Who Am I?

I’m Daniele — a systems engineer with 20+ years of experience in infrastructure, automation, PowerShell, and enterprise systems. This repo is part of my commitment to continuous learning, self-reflection, and the pursuit of real, applied expertise in modern infrastructure.

I used to be a professional teacher and trainer — and once you’ve been a teacher, it never really leaves you. If any part of this journey helps even one person deepen their understanding or feel less alone in the learning process, then sharing it has been worth it.
