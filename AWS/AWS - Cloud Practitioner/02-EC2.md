# EC2 Basics

## First Step – Set up a budget

💰 Before experimenting with EC2 (one of the oldest AWS services) create a **training budget** so you can track or stop unexpected spend.

1. 🔑 Log in as the **root user**. Budgets and the billing dashboard are hidden from IAM users until the root user enables access.
2. 📠 Open **Billing & Cost Management → Account settings**.
3. 👥 In **IAM user and role access to Billing information**, turn on access for IAM identities.
4. 🛑 Create a budget (for exam practice a **Zero Spending Budget** is common). Use the wizard or define custom thresholds and alerts.

## EC2 overview

**Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** it the AWS's *Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)* virtual machine offering, as in any IaaS we are responsible for the security, updates deployment and general configuration of the instances (or VMs) deployed.

Virtual machines named **instances** are provisioned from **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** and among the core capabilities we can find:

- Scale up and down of fleets via **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** to adapt the number of deployed instances to accomodate workload patterns.
- We can attach persistent (*hardware*) storage to an instance or use network attached volumes like **EBS** or **EFS** file systrems.
- Instances can be placed behind an **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** for horizontal distribution of traffic to the instances behind the *ELB*.

 **Exam alert:** *EC2* is a IaaS and as such we are responsible and in control of the various instance components (OS, networking, software, updates) and uses a *pay-as-you-go* model.
